# CovarianceDynamics.jl
 The package implements a mathematically rigorous, finite-dimensional Markovian lift of non-Markovian covariance flows on the manifold of symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices. It supports Lyapunov analysis, invariant-measure diagnostics, and long-time ergodic simulation, while  fully compatible with the SciML differential equation ecosystem.
